# SVD
Use cosine distance to be similarity metric, train a SVD model to recommendation, rate  movies and find the most similar movies. 
# Acknowledge
This demo referred to [PirosB3/PyConUS2018](https://github.com/PirosB3/PyConUS2018).

Based on this project, I rewrited the cosine_distance function and modified some incompatible codes
